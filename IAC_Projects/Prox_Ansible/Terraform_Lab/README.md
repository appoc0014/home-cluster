# This project was used to help build VMs to use for my Ansible project
# Nothing fancy just creating a Ubuntu and CentOS VM
# This demostrates my ability to learn more IAC skills with Terraform for hosting on Proxmox
# Skills I leanred for this project:
# Proxmox
# Variables
# loop by using count
# Connect to a host without using a username/password

# I did remove sensative information and marked if anyone wants to use this code a template to learn from or improve

# All code was created on Ubuntu with VIM
